Follow these steps to deploy your portfolio to GitHub Pages:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Upload Your Portfolio Files

You have two options:

### Option A: Using Git Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to your portfolio folder
cd /app

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pushpendra-singh-portfolio.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web Interface
1. Download all files from `/app` folder
2. In your new GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all the portfolio files
4. Write commit message: "Initial portfolio setup"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository, go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
3. Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
4. The deployment will start automatically!

## Step 4: Update Configuration

Before deployment, update these files with your GitHub username:

1. **Update `/app/package.json`** (line 8):
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/pushpendra-singh-portfolio"
   ```

2. **Update `/app/README.md`** (replace YOUR_USERNAME):
   - Repository URL
   - Homepage URL
   - LinkedIn and GitHub profile links

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You'll see "Deploy Portfolio to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
4. Once complete, your portfolio will be live!

## üåê Your Live Portfolio URL
